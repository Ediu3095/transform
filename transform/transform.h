 *
 * @defgroup core Core features
 *
 * @brief Features that implement in C++ some of the [GLSL specification](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/specs/gl/GLSLangSpec.4.50.pdf) as well as
 * operations described in [Real-Time Rendering](https://www.realtimerendering.com/).
 *
 * The Transform core consists of C++ types and functions that mirror (and extend) those of GLSL. Additionally, it includes common operations in computer
 * graphics as decribed in Real-Time Rendering.
 *
 * This makes the GLSL specification a good documentation for Transform core.
 *
 * Include <transform/transform.h> to use Transform's core functionalities.
